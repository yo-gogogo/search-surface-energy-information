### Project Title
Search for surface energy information.

### Description
This is used to search calculated surface energy results for certain elemental crystals.
The calculated surface_energy, surface_energy_EV_PER_ANG2
and their corresponding area_fraction and miller_index are provided.

### Files used
surfaces.json(you need to download the file on https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.f2n6f)
